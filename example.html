            <p>Once upon a time, there was a developer who wanted to document different ways to accomplish a task.</p>
            
            <p>##basic She decided to use the simple command-line interface to get started quickly. She opened her terminal and typed a few basic commands.</p>
            
            <p>##advanced= She decided to use the advanced API with full configuration options. She created a detailed configuration file with all the parameters optimized for her use case.</p>
            
            <p>##gui She decided to use the graphical user interface which made everything visual and intuitive. She clicked through the menus and found all the options neatly organized in tabs.</p>
            
            <p>## After setting up her environment, she was ready to begin the actual work.</p>
            
            <p>##basic She ran the execute command with default settings: <code>app run --default</code></p>
            
            <p>##advanced= She ran the execute command with custom parameters: <code>app run --config=custom.yml --optimize --parallel=8</code></p>
            
            <p>##gui She clicked the big green "Run" button in the main window and watched the progress bar fill up.</p>
            
            <p>## The process completed successfully, and she was very satisfied with the results.</p>
            
            <p>##basic The basic approach took 5 minutes and was perfect for her quick prototype.</p>
            
            <p>##advanced= The advanced approach took 2 minutes thanks to the optimizations and was ideal for production use.</p>
            
            <p>##gui The GUI approach took 4 minutes and was great because she could monitor everything visually in real-time.</p>
            
            <p>She documented her approach and shared it with her team, and they all lived happily ever after.</p>
